Note: If you are new to docker download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and keep it running before executing above command

## Directory structure

### Overview

You can customize the `src` and `api` directories.

```
src/
â”œâ”€ api/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ User
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ controller.js
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.js
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.test.js
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ model.js
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ model.test.js
â”‚  â””â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€ services/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ express/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ mongoose/
â”‚  â””â”€ response-service/
â”œâ”€ app.js
â”œâ”€ config.js
â””â”€ index.js
```

### src/api/

Here is where the API endpoints are defined. Each API has its own folder.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/model.js

It defines the Mongoose schema and model for the API endpoint. Any changes to the data model should be done here.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/controller.js

This is the API controller file. It defines the main router middlewares which use the API model.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/index.js

This is the entry file of the API. It defines the routes using, along other middlewares (like session, validation etc.), the middlewares defined in the `some-endpoint.controller.js` file.

### services/

Here you can put `helpers`, `libraries` and other types of modules which you want to use in your APIs.
